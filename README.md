## Virtual Guide App

India is a major tourist destination which pulls millions of tourists every year. India is known
for its beautiful beaches and hospitality. There are a number of monuments and landmarks
depicting the cultural, history and development of India. Due to high inflow of domestic as
well as international tourists, the manpower required to guide the tourists on these landmarks
is not sufficient and sometimes lack in the information that needs to be given and highlighted
to the tourist.<br>
Hence, we propose the problem of developing a mobile application which renders
information about the monument or landmark just by taking their live pictures as inputs. In
other words, the application should allow the user to click a photograph and based on the
picture it should display information about the monument/landmark. The application should
also notify the user about such monuments/landmarks in the vicinity. The app should also
allow the user to give their inputs about the object and also add to knowledge creation about
the monuments/landmark. The app should also be able to keep statistics about the number of
users referring to the monument/landmark along with details of the users.

## Features:

● <b>User Login</b>: User can login onto the system, so that the user is uniquely identified.

● <b>Identifying tourist destinations</b>: It should identify tourist destinations when a
landmark/monument is scanned by camera.

● <b>Displaying information about destination</b>: it should provide information about the
monument/landmark that it has identified.

● <b>Notifying about nearby places</b>: When going to a place it should notify about nearby
monuments and landmarks.

● <b>User adding additional information</b>: If a user knows some additional information,
he could write it in the app.

● <b>Authenticating user information</b>: The information user added should be checked so
that no false information should be displayed.
